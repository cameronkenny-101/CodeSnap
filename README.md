# CodeSnap - Interactive Coding Puzzles

A React + TypeScript application that creates interactive, drag-and-drop coding puzzles focused on algorithm learning.

## Features

- **Drag & Drop Code Blocks**: Users drag code snippets into empty slots to complete algorithms
- **Hidden Blocks Mechanism**: Code blocks are revealed gradually, forcing users to think strategically
- **Decoy Blocks**: Some code blocks are decoys that look right but introduce subtle bugs
- **Immediate Feedback**: Get instant feedback on correct or incorrect solutions

## Technologies Used

- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React DnD for drag-and-drop functionality
- Zustand for state management
